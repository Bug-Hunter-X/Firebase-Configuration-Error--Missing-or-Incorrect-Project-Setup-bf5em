To fix this issue, verify your Firebase configuration file and ensure that you've initialized Firebase correctly.  Double check that the `apiKey`, `authDomain`, `projectId`, `storageBucket`, `messagingSenderId`, `appId`, and `measurementId` values are accurate and match your Firebase project settings. Also, make sure that the Firebase JavaScript SDK is correctly installed and linked in your project.
